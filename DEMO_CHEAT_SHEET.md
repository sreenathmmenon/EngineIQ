# EngineIQ Demo Cheat Sheet

## 🎬 **LIVE DEMO QUERIES (TESTED & WORKING)**

### **Story 1: Priya's MongoDB Crisis** ⭐
**Query to type:** `MongoDB replica set primary marked stale`

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ Video results (Understanding MongoDB Replication)
- ✅ Score: ~0.6
- ✅ Multimodal: Shows VIDEO content type

**What to say:**
> "Priya searches for MongoDB issue at 3 AM. EngineIQ finds VIDEO tutorials instantly - no need to wake up the US team. Look - 3 video results, all relevant. This is multimodal search in action."

---

### **Story 2: Rajesh's Architecture** ⚠️
**Query to type:** `payment processing architecture`

**Expected results:**
- Architecture docs/diagrams
- If no results: pivot to existing content

**Backup query:** `architecture diagram overview`

**What to say:**
> "Rajesh needs architecture docs. EngineIQ shows what he CAN access - and explains if anything is restricted. Transparent, ethical AI."

---

### **Story 3: Maria's Kubernetes** ⭐⭐⭐
**Query to type:** `kubernetes local development setup`

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ IMAGE: K8s_Cluster_Overview.png
- ✅ TEXT: DEPLOYMENT.md docs
- ✅ CODE: Slack engineering discussion

**What to say:**
> "Maria searches Kubernetes setup. Look at this - IMAGE diagram, TEXT documentation, and CODE examples from Slack. All three modalities in ONE search! This is how we break language barriers - visual learning for everyone."

---

### **Story 4: Live Upload Demo** ⭐⭐⭐
**Steps:**
1. Show current search for something NEW
2. Open admin dashboard: http://localhost:8000/admin.html
3. Drag-drop a new PDF (have one ready!)
4. Wait for processing (show it happening)
5. Search again - NEW result appears!

**What to say:**
> "Watch knowledge creation in real-time. I upload this document... Gemini analyzing... Qdrant indexing... Done! Now search again - BOOM! Immediately searchable. Knowledge created by ONE, available to EVERYONE."

## 🚨 **DEMO EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**

### **If Search Fails:**
→ "The agent is running - let me show you the admin dashboard instead"
→ Show stats, show architecture diagram on screen

### **If Upload Fails:**
→ "I've already uploaded 1,233 documents - let me show you the variety"
→ Do different search queries

### **If Internet Down:**
→ Have pre-recorded video backup
→ Have screenshots in slide deck

### **If Server Crashes:**
→ Restart in 30 seconds (practice this!)
→ Or pivot to slide deck + video

## 🎤 **POWERFUL QUOTES TO USE**

**Opening:**
> "In technology, knowledge is power - but it's NOT equally distributed."

**During MongoDB demo:**
> "Priya doesn't need to wait 8 hours for HQ to wake up. This is time zone equity."

**During Kubernetes demo:**
> "Look - IMAGE, TEXT, and CODE. Visual learning for Maria. No language barriers."

**During upload:**
> "Knowledge created by ONE engineer, available to ALL engineers. This is democratization."

**Closing:**
> "We're not just building software. We're building equity in technology. For Priya. For Rajesh. For Maria. For every engineer."
