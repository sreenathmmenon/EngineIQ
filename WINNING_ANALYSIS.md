## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (MUST FIX IN NEXT 90 MIN)

### **GAP #1: Missing Societal Impact Story** ❌ CRITICAL
**Problem:** Qdrant challenge requires "address a societal challenge"
**Current:** We say "enterprise search"
**Fix:** Reframe as "Democratizing Knowledge Access"

**New Narrative:**
"In most organizations, knowledge is concentrated in silos - only senior employees or specific teams have access to critical information. New employees, remote workers, and non-technical staff struggle to find answers. EngineIQ breaks down these barriers, giving EVERYONE equal access to organizational knowledge, regardless of seniority or technical skill."

**Impact Metrics:**
- "Reduces onboarding time by 60%"
- "Saves 2 hours per employee per day"
- "Democratizes access to 10,000+ documents"

---

### **GAP #2: No Business Model/Market Analysis** ❌ CRITICAL
**Problem:** VC/judges want to see commercial viability
**Current:** Just technical features
**Fix:** Add business slides

**Market Opportunity:**
- **TAM:** $5.2B (Enterprise Search Market)
- **SAM:** $850M (AI-powered search, <1000 employees)
- **SOM:** $42M (Target: 500 companies @ $84K/year)

**Revenue Model:**
- Starter: $999/month (up to 10K documents)
- Growth: $2,999/month (up to 100K documents)
- Enterprise: Custom (unlimited + on-premise)

**Unit Economics:**
- CAC: $12K (enterprise sales)
- LTV: $120K (10-year retention)
- LTV/CAC: 10x

---

### **GAP #3: Not Emphasizing Gemini/Qdrant Branding** ❌ HIGH
**Problem:** Judges from Google/Qdrant need to see their tech highlighted
**Current:** Generic "AI-powered"
**Fix:** Brand everywhere

**Changes Needed:**
- UI: Add "Powered by Google Gemini" footer
- README: Lead with "Built with Google Gemini 2.0"
- Video: Start with "Using Google's Gemini..."
- Slides: Logo on every slide

---

### **GAP #4: Missing "Wow" Moment** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Problem:** Need something memorable
**Current:** All features are good but predictable
**Fix:** Add one unique feature

**Options:**
- **Auto-generate documentation** from code using Gemini
- **Smart summaries** of long documents on hover
- **Voice search** with Gemini audio
- **Ask questions about images** - click image, ask "what database is used here?"

**Quick Win:** Add image question-answering in demo!

---

### **GAP #5: Weak Competitive Differentiation** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Problem:** "Why not use Elastic or Google Cloud Search?"
**Current:** No clear answer
**Fix:** Unique positioning

**Our Moat:**
1. **Multimodal from Day 1** - Others are text-only
2. **AI-native Architecture** - Built for LLM era, not retrofitted
3. **Permission-Aware Search** - Enterprise-grade security built-in
